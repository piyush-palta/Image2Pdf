#Photos 2 PDF

##First Thoughts
---
This is supposed to be short project, to convert photos to pdf. Done mostly for fun and self aiding, bored of using online converters. Though initially starting with a code that has to be manually updated for different images, end product will supposedly a GUI. So if everything goes well we'll end up with something useful.
